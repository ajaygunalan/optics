1
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.415
All right, now let's begin to relax one of our approximations,

2
00:00:10.415 --> 00:00:14.300
which is to say, let's relax the thin lens approximation.

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.440
Let's figure out what the power of an actual curved piece of

4
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.315
glass would be because that's what we want the design in the end is real-world optics.

5
00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:24.920
So to do that, let's just take

6
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.532
a single-surface bounding indices n and n prime with a positive radius of curvature by

7
00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:35.900
our coordinate system R. Let's first find the height of

8
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.865
this surface measured from

9
00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:40.580
the radius of curvature and this is not obeying our sign convention,

10
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.120
just the distance from the rays of curvature to the surface.

11
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.635
Of course, the surface is a sphere so that's an easy thing to do.

12
00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:54.184
Once again, we will make our paraxial approximation that is we're still paraxial,

13
00:00:54.184 --> 00:00:56.330
just not flat surfaces anymore,

14
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.150
and take only the first and second terms

15
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.260
or the lowest in quadratic terms of the square root.

16
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.720
So that gives us a parabolic approximation of your spherical surface.

17
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.240
Now, let's calculate the optical path length through this not-flat surface.

18
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.320
And by optical path length theorem we just mean projection and integration along Z axis,

19
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.870
so we are just going to calculate nL along the Z axis,

20
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.880
and some distance off of the axis,

21
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.175
perhaps on this line here for

22
00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:31.955
a total thickness of some arbitrary constant d measured from the origin.

23
00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:34.435
So we have nL,

24
00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:35.588
the distance in air,

25
00:01:35.588 --> 00:01:38.155
and then n prime L prime,

26
00:01:38.155 --> 00:01:39.865
the distance in the glass.

27
00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:41.635
Because we have this expression,

28
00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:44.245
we know what L and L prime are,

29
00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:47.290
they're that various pieces of that parabola.

30
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.880
We can factor out the terms there,

31
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.750
we get a term that's a constant and constants

32
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.835
don't matter because they don't transform the shape of the wave front.

33
00:01:55.835 --> 00:01:58.585
But the one that's left is very interesting.

34
00:01:58.585 --> 00:01:59.900
Notice that we've, once again,

35
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.255
found an optical path length and it's quadratic,

36
00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.875
it depends on R squared.

37
00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:07.610
Since we already have an expression for the optical path length from

38
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.255
a few slides ago and it's R squared over 2f,

39
00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:13.849
we can now set this quantity equal to one over 2f,

40
00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.840
there's one over two there,

41
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.580
we find a really important expression.

42
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.220
The power of the lens, one of the focal length,

43
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.315
is one over the radius of curvature times the difference in the indices.

44
00:02:26.315 --> 00:02:30.800
Again, it's just convenient to have the variable and the upside-down variables,

45
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.565
let's define one over R as the curvature,

46
00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:35.640
that's in units of inverse meters.

47
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.230
So the power of a surface is related to

48
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.240
the curvature times the difference of

49
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.470
the indices or a fraction of the two surfaces that bounce.

50
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.375
That's the beginning of what will allow us to design

51
00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:52.150
real optics from our thin paraxial first order designs.

52
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.380
Now, I mentioned that Fermat's principle was

53
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.052
the sophisticated way to design the power of the lens.

54
00:02:59.052 --> 00:03:04.745
Perhaps, more fundamental, less-sophisticated way is use Snell's law.

55
00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:07.775
So, let's stop for a minute and do that,

56
00:03:07.775 --> 00:03:11.040
it's slightly painful and you'll understand from this why you like

57
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.645
Optic Studio to do lots of calculations for you just to confirm you get the same answer.

58
00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:17.790
And then we begin to get us coordinate systems and

59
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.250
useful insight when we do a little more sophisticated ray tracing by hand.

60
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.260
So, here's that same surface with

61
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.200
positive radius of curvature bounding materials n and n prime.

62
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:37.300
I'm going to shoot it right off the axis with angle u that turns into array of u prime.

63
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.200
I'm going to have to draw a normal to the surface up here and

64
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.075
define rays i and i prime, our angles,

65
00:03:43.075 --> 00:03:46.770
i and i prime, that are my typical Snell's law angles of

66
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.010
incidence and let's say I hit the lens at some height y.

67
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.305
That's enough for me to solve the problem.

68
00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:56.695
So, here in the paraxial version of Snell's law

69
00:03:56.695 --> 00:04:00.435
where i and i prime have replaced sine i and sine i prime,

70
00:04:00.435 --> 00:04:04.890
I can go figure out what I is relative to u. Alpha is

71
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.610
the angle that the normal to the surface makes with the optical axis.

72
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.675
So I can replace i with more fundamental variables that relate to my ray.

73
00:04:14.675 --> 00:04:19.440
And then I can go use some geometry or similar triangles to figure out that u is

74
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.870
y over t and alpha is y over R and so we can make those replacements,

75
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.870
many things cancel out.

76
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.577
And when I cancel y,

77
00:04:28.577 --> 00:04:31.920
I should be able to cancel y because in the paraxial limit,

78
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.045
it should not matter what my ray height is,

79
00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:37.033
that's what it means to be paraxial.

80
00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:38.310
And look at that, I get

81
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.250
exactly the same Gaussian lens equation that pops out

82
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.329
again and the same power for the surface,

83
00:04:44.329 --> 00:04:47.300
one over the radius times the difference in their refractive indices.

84
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.017
So, this is not the sophisticated way to go at it,

85
00:04:50.017 --> 00:04:53.700
I think Fermat's principle is much simpler but it confirms that

86
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.940
Fermat's principle agrees with Snell's law, which is nice.

87
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:06.430
So, that's our first step in transforming thin lenses into curved pieces of glass.

88
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.220
The thing that connects those is the concept of

89
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.180
the optical path length and from that, we can derive,

90
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.880
then, how the optical path length of

91
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.210
a curved surface relates to the Gaussian thin lens equation.
