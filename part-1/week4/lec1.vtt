00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.295
In the previous lectures,

2
00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:09.755
we started with graphical ray tracing.

3
00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:12.545
And by shooting the three principal rays,

4
00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:13.805
one, two, and three,

5
00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:18.755
we learned things like the system magnification and thin lens equations,

6
00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:22.250
which told us something about image conditions, and magnifications,

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.120
and useful properties of a system.

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.040
When we went to Optic Studio,

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.210
we saw rays moving through potentially complex optical systems,

10
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.130
refracting at every surface.

11
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.140
And in that case,

12
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.210
those rays were really carrying information about the entire optical field,

13
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.895
its phase, and solving Maxwell's equations.

14
00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:46.490
What we want to start doing now is,

15
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.170
filling in the gap between those,

16
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.220
moving from the simple graphical techniques towards

17
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.525
more sophisticated views of what a lens is and what it means to do ray tracing?

18
00:00:57.525 --> 00:00:59.470
The first thing we need to do,

19
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.840
is actually calculate the optical path length of a lens.

20
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.250
That's a function that describes how

21
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.745
the lens transforms the phase fronts that are incident on it.

22
00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:15.640
And remember, optical path length,

23
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.105
which we derived or defined before, is simply, N times L,

24
00:01:19.105 --> 00:01:24.398
or more formally, the integral of N along the ray,

25
00:01:24.398 --> 00:01:29.225
and that tells us something about the phase that's accumulated along the ray.

26
00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:33.955
Now, we could do that through a lot of techniques but the technique which is

27
00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:38.245
really convenient for doing this calculation is Fermat's principle.

28
00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:41.500
And this is an example of where knowing these deeper laws,

29
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.260
like Fermat's principle, allows you to do things very,

30
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.380
very simply and quickly.

31
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.560
So, what we are going to do is,

32
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.985
we are going to imagine launching some light off of an object in multiple directions.

33
00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:56.445
It goes through a lens and converges back to an image.

34
00:01:56.445 --> 00:02:01.540
Fermat's principle states that no matter what direction we shoot the ray,

35
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.690
by the time they all get back to the image,

36
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.770
the total optical path length, or transit time,

37
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.610
should be invariant to the ray direction,

38
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.750
it should be stationary using the language of mathematics.

39
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.005
And this kind of makes physical sense.

40
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:22.780
If you think about a set of waves converging toward the image here,

41
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.575
if they weren't all in phase,

42
00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:27.505
we wouldn't have constructive interference at the image point,

43
00:02:27.505 --> 00:02:30.900
and actually generate a converging spherical wave there,

44
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.065
so that's the physical interpretation of it.

45
00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:35.135
The calculation is quite simple.

46
00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:36.430
On the left hand side,

47
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.440
we're going to simply calculate

48
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.250
the optical path length of a ray that goes right down the axis, there's NT,

49
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.310
with the minus sign,

50
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.526
of course, because this is a minus distance,

51
00:02:44.526 --> 00:02:50.130
negative distance, and then continues on to the image N prime T prime.

52
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.420
Now, I could have some thickness of the lens right there and that's just a constant,

53
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.825
constants don't matter because they don't change the shape of the wave front,

54
00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:00.990
so I'm going to set that equal to zero.

55
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.265
I could have put a constant here,

56
00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.055
wouldn't have made any difference.

57
00:03:04.055 --> 00:03:08.865
I'm beginning to set that optical path length equal to a ray,

58
00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:13.520
to that of a ray that goes up to some arbitrary distance R and back down.

59
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.365
So I calculate new distances based on that hypotenuse of that triangle,

60
00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.945
the same thing over on the right hand side.

61
00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:24.170
And now, I add in a correction factor.

62
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.895
This must be what the lens does, what extra phase,

63
00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:32.930
what extra optical path length it adds in order to make this condition true,

64
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.560
in order to make Fermat's principal happen.

65
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.285
Because we're going to be paraxial here,

66
00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:42.770
or first order design as in the name of the course,

67
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.740
we are going to take these angles to be sufficiently

68
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.610
small that we can take sine theta and tan theta equal to theta.

69
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.075
Snell's law simplifies N theta equals N theta,

70
00:03:56.075 --> 00:04:00.110
and in the case of these square root functions here,

71
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.560
we'll take the binomial approximation and just keep the first term.

72
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.900
So, that's all the same approximation at the small angle paraxial approximation.

73
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.543
So, when we do that, we get terms will cancel out,

74
00:04:13.543 --> 00:04:16.490
you see the NT here and the N prime T prime,

75
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.155
and so we can solve for the optical path length of the lens.

76
00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:24.185
Of course, it's quadratic because that's all we kept here.

77
00:04:24.185 --> 00:04:27.090
Wasn't really, doesn't really matter what the shape of the lens was,

78
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.665
we're only retaining the quadratic terms so, unsurprisingly,

79
00:04:30.665 --> 00:04:35.140
we find a quadratic form for the optical path length.

80
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.860
The interesting bit is what's in parentheses here,

81
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.205
because this is an old friend.

82
00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:42.895
That looks like the Gaussian thin lens equation, which we already know,

83
00:04:42.895 --> 00:04:47.405
so we can replace the bit in parentheses with one over the focal length.

84
00:04:47.405 --> 00:04:54.345
So, the optical path length of a paraxial thin lens is minus R squared over 2f.

85
00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:55.715
That's an important expression,

86
00:04:55.715 --> 00:04:57.353
we're going to use that a lot.

87
00:04:57.353 --> 00:05:00.880
Let's pause for a minute and make sure this makes sense.

88
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.005
Remember, I said I dropped an arbitrary constant right in the axis here,

89
00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:06.685
the term that we left out here,

90
00:05:06.685 --> 00:05:09.400
so I can put any constant I want in here.

91
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.835
Constant optical path lengths aren't interesting,

92
00:05:11.835 --> 00:05:13.510
it's only their shape that matters.

93
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.965
So, let me imagine, I put just S 0,

94
00:05:14.965 --> 00:05:16.465
some constant in here,

95
00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:22.850
that would represent the optical path length N times L at the center of the lens.

96
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.275
For positive focal length lens, F,

97
00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:30.585
then we see that quadratically going away from the axis,

98
00:05:30.585 --> 00:05:32.295
the lens gets thinner.

99
00:05:32.295 --> 00:05:35.460
The optical path length decreases.

100
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.690
That makes sense, that's what a lens should do.

101
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.740
If, of course, the focal length was negative,

102
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.035
the opposite would occur,

103
00:05:42.035 --> 00:05:45.790
and it would get thicker going away from the origin,

104
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.359
and it does that proportional to 1 over F. So,

105
00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:52.930
the quantity 1 over F is powerful enough,

106
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.085
is important enough that we need a name for it, we're going to use this a lot.

107
00:05:56.085 --> 00:05:57.675
We call it the power.

108
00:05:57.675 --> 00:05:59.790
It's just a convenient variable.

109
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.695
It's got units of one over meters,

110
00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:03.128
and that's useful enough,

111
00:06:03.128 --> 00:06:05.940
we give it its own name, in optics, called diopters.

112
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.330
And if you have eyeglasses,

113
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.750
you've heard of diopters.

114
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.180
One diopter of correction is a relatively weak correction, for example.

115
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.750
So, a powerful lens,

116
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.665
a large number here,

117
00:06:17.665 --> 00:06:20.410
that meaning a short focal length,

118
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.880
would mean that the change of the optical path length with radius was vast.

119
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.230
Powerful lenses are very curved,

120
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.980
weak lenses, small power,

121
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.900
few diopters, a one-diopter eyeglass lens,

122
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.950
for example, are relatively shallow in their curvature.

123
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.115
So, powerful lenses are lots of curvature,

124
00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:46.977
weak lenses are little curvature.

125
00:06:46.977 --> 00:06:49.655
That power concept is useful in lots of ways,

126
00:06:49.655 --> 00:06:51.340
but here's the first one.

127
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.610
We can restate our Gaussian thin lens equation by

128
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.754
replacing 1 over F with this power, Phi,

129
00:06:58.754 --> 00:07:02.140
and we can now interpret that as

130
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.930
a transformation of the radius of curvature of the lens because of the wavefront.

131
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.100
Here, we have a radiating spherical wave and at the lens,

132
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.900
it would have a radius of curvature equal to T. It gets

133
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:19.315
transformed into a converging spherical wave with radius of curvature T prime.

134
00:07:19.315 --> 00:07:20.980
What this equation tells us,

135
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.845
a different way of thinking about the Gaussian thin lens equation,

136
00:07:23.845 --> 00:07:27.280
is that the lens simply adds power,

137
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.687
in the case of a positive lens,

138
00:07:28.687 --> 00:07:31.420
that transforms this radius of curvature,

139
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.520
which would be negative in our sign convention,

140
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.810
to this radius of curvature, which would be positive.

141
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.270
If, for example, the object is just at the focal length,

142
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.160
such that the radius of curvature of

143
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.131
the emerging spherical wave is equal to the power of the lens,

144
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:49.045
then we get an infinite radius of curvature,

145
00:07:49.045 --> 00:07:52.820
which is consistent with having the object at the front focal plane.

146
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.280
This is a slightly more sophisticated way to think about what lenses do,

147
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.870
they transform radii of curvature.
