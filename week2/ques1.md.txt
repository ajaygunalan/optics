Design goal
Design a 20 mm diameter singlet lens for visible light made from Schott N-BK7 glass that operates at f number 5 (written f/5). The lens should operate with an angular field of view of up to ±4 degrees from the optic axis.

Initial Calculations
Before we jump into OpticStudio, let's do a few calculations.

What is the required focal length (in mm) of the lens described above? Hint: Look up “f-number” on Wikipedia. 

What is the refractive index of the N-BK7 glass from the Schott corporation at the optical wavelength of 588 nm, which is called the “sodium D line."  Enter the number to at least 4 decimal points. Hint: The OpticStudio Glass Report function of the Materials Catalog is a simple way to find this.

For a plano-convex lens, what is the surface radius of curvature (in mm) required to yield the desired focal length?  Hint: Look up the “Lens” entry of Wikipedia to understand the terminology for a “plano-convex” lens.  Read about the “Lensmaker’s equation,” found on the same page,  or go to the lecture later in this course entitled “Lens Maker’s Equation.”  In this equation, let R be the curved side and R be infinite (that is, side two is flat or “plano.”)   

Once you have the numbers above, you're ready to get started using OpticStudio. Move on to the next reading for the next steps.
