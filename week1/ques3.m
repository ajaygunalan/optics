% When a ray of light traveling in air hits a tilted plane parallel slab (of glass, say), 
% it emerges parallel to the original ray but shifted transversely.
% 
% Carefully draw out the situation and use Snell’s law to derive the amount of the transverse shift, 
% x, as a function of the tilt angle of the slab, θ, its thickness,  d,  and its index of refraction, n. 
% 
% Find the exact expression with no approximations. 
% 
% We recommend you do this out all in variables because it's a useful formula to have.
% Also, you will want this for the following questions.
% 
% However, since the auto-grader has difficulty with these formulas, use 
% n=1.5, d=1.0 cm, and  θ = 45° and enter a numerical answer. Give your answer in cm to two significant figures.
