00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.440
We looked at the power and the focal length of a single thick lens here.

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.570
We can also apply the same types of techniques to a two lens system.

3
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.625
Right now I'm going to look at a positive lens.

4
00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:24.040
And find the focal length that is positive lens.

5
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.720
It does have some thickness.

6
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.085
That's why I'll need to trace my rays back along here.

7
00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:34.810
My parallel rays coming in and see where they overlap.

8
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.323
Conceivably somewhere inside this lens,

9
00:00:37.323 --> 00:00:39.565
and measure my focal length.

10
00:00:39.565 --> 00:00:42.835
And I have a negative lens.

11
00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:49.540
I can do the same thing, I can take these rays and follow them all the way back

12
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:56.810
here to find the front focus for my virtual images because I have diverging rays.

13
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.820
And we can see where those rays overlap with these parallel rays.

14
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.250
This is a fairly thin lens so maybe right here in

15
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.045
the center where I can measure my focal length of this lens.

16
00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:11.549
Now what happens when I put those two lenses together?

17
00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.150
These are designed to fit pretty closely together.

18
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.005
And if I put these two lenses together and I send in parallel rays,

19
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:25.010
we get almost parallel rays out.

20
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.230
So what does that tell me about the two focal lengths of the lenses?

21
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.490
Are they two powers these two lenses?

22
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.215
Another total power of the system,

23
00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:43.200
so I have rays coming in and going at the same angle [inaudible] easier.

24
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.870
So the power of one of these lenses needs to

25
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.260
be equal and opposite to the other which gives

26
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.585
me that these focal lengths is effective focal length

27
00:01:51.585 --> 00:01:55.530
also need to be pretty close to equal and opposite.

28
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.935
They're not perfect rays there is converging here a little bit.

29
00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:05.385
Now as I move this negative lens further out,

30
00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:08.570
if I increased the distance between these two lenses,

31
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:15.400
what's going to happen to the rays?

32
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.300
What are those rays going to do as they travel through the lenses?

33
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.980
What does it mean about the power of the system if we

34
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.150
take these two lenses and treat them as a single lens?

35
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.570
What is the power of that new two lens system as I increase

36
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.715
the distance between the two? Let's go ahead and do it.

37
00:02:35.715 --> 00:02:37.925
So as I go up further and further,

38
00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:44.510
it looks like the focus is coming [inaudible] at the focal length,

39
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.460
effective focal length, of this two lens system.

40
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.975
The distance from the principal planes that's where we draw

41
00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:59.800
these back and see where they overlap with the parallel rays coming in,

42
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.720
it should be in here somewhere.

43
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.525
This effective focal length is now shorter.

44
00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:07.020
I have a shorter focal length

45
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.610
and so the power of my system is greater.

46
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.885
And as I increase d the power in that focal length,

47
00:03:13.885 --> 00:03:20.500
the focal length decreases and the power increases.

48
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.510
And as I decrease d to almost zero my power

49
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.280
goes to approximately zero as well because I have matched focal length here.
