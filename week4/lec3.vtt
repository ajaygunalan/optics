1
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:12.640
Now, that we have an expression for how a single curved surface reflects light,

2
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.390
we can relate the radii of curvature of that surface,

3
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.732
and the two effective indices to a one's power, or focal length.

4
00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:22.765
Of course, we'd like to have lenses with two sides.

5
00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:25.175
So we'd like two surfaces.

6
00:00:25.175 --> 00:00:28.660
So now let's work out what you do,

7
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.695
when you have two optical elements in the path.

8
00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:37.225
The first thing to do is to back up two or thin per axial approximation,

9
00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:39.175
and see what that tells us.

10
00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:42.110
So here we have our traditional imaging problem.

11
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.215
But now let's imagine,

12
00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:44.665
that instead of a single ends,

13
00:00:44.665 --> 00:00:49.315
we've contacted two lenses of power V-1 and V-2,

14
00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:52.990
and they're thin, so they can be in intimate contact.

15
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.850
Presumably, they should operate like

16
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.285
some equivalent single lens of some equivalent focal length.

17
00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:01.795
The question is what is that focal length?

18
00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:05.315
So, once again, optical path length is the way to solve this problem.

19
00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.290
And remember, optical path length is just an integration along

20
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.495
the ray path of the index refraction times the distance along the path.

21
00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:18.155
And the paraxial version of that expression is simply integration in Z.

22
00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:21.565
So in other words, if we know the optical path length of these two lenses,

23
00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:25.670
then the sum is what the effective ones would look like.

24
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.005
We reasonably, add the optical path length of the two lenses.

25
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:31.715
So that's a super simple calculation.

26
00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:35.000
We just add the two optical path lengths.

27
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.535
If we see one over F-1, and one over F-2 here,

28
00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:39.650
of course, we can factor that out.

29
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.915
This expression looks just like the original expression.

30
00:01:43.915 --> 00:01:47.350
So quite simply, one over the focal length of

31
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.394
the combined lenses is one over F-1 plus one over F-2.

32
00:01:52.394 --> 00:01:55.345
And if we turn those all into powers by inverting them,

33
00:01:55.345 --> 00:01:59.110
and this is probably the primary motivation for using optical power,

34
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.131
we see that powers add.

35
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:03.295
Pause the video here for a moment,

36
00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:05.250
and think about the following question.

37
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.955
If you're in the lab, and you have

38
00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:10.760
two 50 millimeter lenses and you put them back to back,

39
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.965
what's the focal length then of the pair of lenses?

40
00:02:14.965 --> 00:02:18.540
Put them in mid contact.

41
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.275
The answer to that, if you've thought about it, is 25 millimeters.

42
00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.015
Because one over 50,

43
00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:27.380
plus one over 50, must equal one over 25.

44
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.831
So that's again, why you have to think in powers,

45
00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:31.724
powers are the things that had linearly,

46
00:02:31.724 --> 00:02:34.280
and that trick by the way is something you often do in the lab.

47
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.906
You don't have all lenses you need,

48
00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:38.070
you can roughly paraxially,

49
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.420
synthesize what you need,

50
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.880
by stacking up other lenses of

51
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.910
longer total focal length that always will shorten for positive lenses course.

52
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.705
Okay. Now we're ready to do something they would say is real.

53
00:02:51.705 --> 00:02:54.445
If we have a lens,

54
00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:57.063
let's put it in vacuum to start out,

55
00:02:57.063 --> 00:02:59.245
to make life simple, so indexing one.

56
00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:02.025
It has a glass of a particular refractive index,

57
00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:06.660
and it's bound by two radii of curvature, R-1 and R-2.

58
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.735
We will first simplify that to our equivalent thin lens system.

59
00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:13.890
We're not going to worry about these surfaces.

60
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.050
We actually hit them at odd positions of the axis.

61
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.745
So we'll make that an equivalent thin lens system.

62
00:03:21.745 --> 00:03:26.925
And so that's V-1 and V-2 whatever those are, index or reflection.

63
00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:34.555
And in middle separated by some distance D. So here's the expression we have from before.

64
00:03:34.555 --> 00:03:38.575
The power of that equivalent two lens system,

65
00:03:38.575 --> 00:03:41.815
if the lenses were in intimate contact D equals zero,

66
00:03:41.815 --> 00:03:43.670
is V-1 plus V-2.

67
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.415
It turns out that the correction to that,

68
00:03:45.415 --> 00:03:47.650
and there's a finite distance is this term here,

69
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.090
we don't quite have the tools yet to derive that in a convenient way.

70
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.885
So please just accept it right now.

71
00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:56.495
We'll come back and fix that fairly quickly.

72
00:03:56.495 --> 00:04:00.190
So this is the expression for what's the power of a two lens system.

73
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.576
This two lens system,

74
00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:05.195
when there's a finite distance D, between the two lenses.

75
00:04:05.195 --> 00:04:07.000
So if you'll believe that for a moment,

76
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.950
then we know the power of,

77
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.360
equivalent power thin lens surfaces for single pieces of glass,

78
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.300
so we can substitute V-1 and V-2 throughout,

79
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.370
and we get this expression here,

80
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.725
which is called the Lens maker's equation,

81
00:04:20.725 --> 00:04:25.010
and it's actually the place you start when you were designing real lenses.

82
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.246
If you want a particular power V,

83
00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:29.176
you had a particular index N,

84
00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:32.240
you see that you have two degrees of freedom here.

85
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.660
Well, sorry three degrees of freedom, C-1, C-2,

86
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.915
and D. That gives you the idea of where optics studio might come in,

87
00:04:38.915 --> 00:04:44.515
or more sophisticated design techniques to choose what those three variables would be.

88
00:04:44.515 --> 00:04:48.285
Because here you have one constraint on those three variants.

89
00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:50.763
This is how you'd start to build real lenses.

90
00:04:50.763 --> 00:04:52.985
If the lens is reasonably thin,

91
00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:55.690
D is smaller than both the radii of curvature.

92
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.115
We can throw away this term,

93
00:04:57.115 --> 00:04:58.940
and we get back to a simpler expression.

94
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.200
And now you see it's just the difference in the radii of curvature,

95
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.175
and the difference in their refractive indices.

96
00:05:04.175 --> 00:05:05.950
If we didn't have vacuum here,

97
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.190
all of the one's here would turn

98
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.540
into the refractive index of the medium in which were a must.

99
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.360
So that equation is really important,

100
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.015
because it tells you how to build real lenses.

101
00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:19.720
And it's also got this nugget in it that you were left with degrees of freedom,

102
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.420
radii of curvature, and distances.

103
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.855
These are your degrees of freedom, as a designer,

104
00:05:23.855 --> 00:05:25.495
and this is now one constraint,

105
00:05:25.495 --> 00:05:30.165
that gives you a paraxial power on this singlet lens.

106
00:05:30.165 --> 00:05:33.920
Singlet lenses are so common that it's worth

107
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.415
giving all the different possible shapes names.

108
00:05:37.415 --> 00:05:42.570
If both surfaces are convex, It's a Biconvex.

109
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.670
If one of the surfaces has an infinite radius of curvature, it's flat.

110
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.465
We call it a Plano-convex, or Plano-concave.

111
00:05:52.465 --> 00:05:57.383
If both surfaces are curved with the same sign,

112
00:05:57.383 --> 00:06:00.295
you see these are both positive radii of curvature,

113
00:06:00.295 --> 00:06:02.520
then the lens is called a meniscus.

114
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.230
That's kind of like a physical object,

115
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.530
like a meniscus water or film.

116
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.300
And finally, correct the other end,

117
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.475
if both surfaces are concave,

118
00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:12.045
and so Biconcave lens.

119
00:06:12.045 --> 00:06:15.120
Those are just words that's useful to have.
