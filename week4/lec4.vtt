00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.530
Now that we have an equation which relates the radii of

2
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.465
curvature and the index of refraction of a lens to the paraxial power or focal length,

3
00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:27.180
we'd like the same thing for our other primary way of focusing light which are mirrors.

4
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.210
So let's derive the equivalent of the lens makers' equation for mirrors.

5
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.595
It turns out, there's a fairly easy way to do this.

6
00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:40.725
If we imagine that we put an object at the radius of curvature,

7
00:00:40.725 --> 00:00:47.250
such that rays launched from this object hit the mirror at normal incidence,

8
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.825
or equivalently since rays represent the normal to the face fronts,

9
00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:56.775
we're launching a spherical face front, a spherical wave,

10
00:00:56.775 --> 00:00:59.580
and that spherical wave would perfectly match

11
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.450
the curvature of the mirror once it got out of the mirror.

12
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.375
And of course that that turns around the ray or the wave front,

13
00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:10.755
and heads right back to the original position,

14
00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:13.215
the origin of the coordinate system.

15
00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:17.295
Thus that particular condition is an imaging condition,

16
00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:22.500
and we just write our thin lens equation for that imaging condition.

17
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.185
And then we'll know how to figure out what focal length is.

18
00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:30.125
The only tricky bit here of course is the sun convention for mirrors.

19
00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:32.910
So let's review that again.

20
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.370
This is not something you're going to use too often,

21
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.310
because it's often the case you simply unfold the system.

22
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.220
But you will have to use this in optics studio,

23
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.190
at least the negative distances,

24
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.015
and so it's worth one more review.

25
00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:48.390
So first we have our mirror here,

26
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.120
the radius of curvature is negative because

27
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.775
the center of the radius of curvature is to the left of the vertex of the mirror.

28
00:01:56.775 --> 00:01:59.280
The infinite light is coming from

29
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.850
an object here at the origin of the radius of curvature,

30
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.790
the origin of the sphere.

31
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.190
And because that point is to the left of the vertex,

32
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.710
the object distance T is negative.

33
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.145
And I've written therefore a minus T because I write positive quantities on my diagrams.

34
00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:18.480
Of course the refractive index of air, or vacuum,

35
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.650
or whatever we're in, is index N. When we hit the mirror,

36
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.175
the image shows up back here over to the left of the vertex,

37
00:02:27.175 --> 00:02:30.180
and therefore we have a minus T prime.

38
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.460
That's just the standard number line coordinate system.

39
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.455
But if we didn't do anything else,

40
00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:39.710
that minus T prime wouldn't work in our thin lens equation because

41
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.580
our thin lens equation would normally want try to work for a lens for example and,

42
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.665
in that case, T prime would be positive for a real image.

43
00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:51.660
And so the way we correct for that,

44
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.075
to make a thin lens equations work,

45
00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:59.110
is the index of refraction after we hit the mirror is taken to be negative.

46
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.755
In optics studio, this is done for you automatically,

47
00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:03.515
you don't have to worry about the index,

48
00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:05.610
you only have to put in the negative distance.

49
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.740
And that will be obvious if you done it wrong

50
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.480
because you'll have rays on the wrong side of the mirror.

51
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.695
So let's take that condition,

52
00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:16.650
and now put this into our thin lens equation.

53
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.000
N prime over T prime, minus N over T,

54
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.175
equals 1 over F. But N prime is minus N,

55
00:03:23.175 --> 00:03:27.240
T prime is R, both negative quantities.

56
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.095
And this N and T here is again,

57
00:03:32.095 --> 00:03:34.523
or again both negative quantities.

58
00:03:34.523 --> 00:03:39.660
And by the way you'll notice that this is a positive quantity,

59
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.120
this is a positive quantity,

60
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.630
N over minus R. And this is a positive point.

61
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.530
So all the actual ratios here,

62
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.940
if you include this minus sign, are all positive.

63
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.410
And it is worth going through and convincing

64
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.480
yourself that you've got all those signs correct.

65
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.990
So given the sign convention now,

66
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.750
we can put these two quantities together because they're equal.

67
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.715
And we find that one over the focal length,

68
00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:04.485
which is the power of the mirror,

69
00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:12.395
is simply two N over minus R. Or the focal length is R over two.

70
00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:16.320
And that's pretty simple, it's pretty obvious,

71
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.725
because what we have here is the one to one imaging condition,

72
00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:23.110
we have two F to the optic.

73
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.905
Then another two F to the image.

74
00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:28.800
And that's our simple one to one imaging condition.

75
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.900
So when you have an object at the center of the radius of curvature,

76
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.015
it re-images upside down,

77
00:04:34.015 --> 00:04:36.850
negative magnification back to that same image.

78
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.370
Remember that the radius of curvature in this coordinate system is negative.

79
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.560
So the minus sign here tells us that overall,

80
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.065
we have a positive focal length mirror,

81
00:04:46.065 --> 00:04:49.380
which is consistent with our sign convention that a ray coming in parallel to

82
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.950
the axis is bent down towards the axis upon reflection.

83
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.445
So you've seen this in the demo videos,

84
00:04:57.445 --> 00:04:59.610
but let's just quickly remind ourselves,

85
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.055
if we sent rays into a lens with a positive radius of curvature,

86
00:05:04.055 --> 00:05:07.060
its center of curvature is to the right to the element.

87
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.690
The rays would be deviated off the axis and we'd

88
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.480
see what is clearly a negative element with a virtual image.

89
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.405
Conversely, if we have a negative radius of curvature,

90
00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:22.990
because the radius of curvature is to the left of the element,

91
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.005
then the rays that come in parallel are sent towards the axis.

92
00:05:28.005 --> 00:05:30.470
They must of course converge to the focal point.

93
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.060
We know though that would be halfway between the mirror and

94
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.759
its center of curvature because the focal length is the radius over two.

95
00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.814
But there's that important minus sign there,

96
00:05:39.814 --> 00:05:45.685
that this negative radius of curvature corresponds to the positive focal length.

97
00:05:45.685 --> 00:05:50.955
Let's put our elements together just as a practice.

98
00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:55.840
There's a particular optical element called the Mangin mirror.

99
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.150
It's nothing more than a meniscus singlet,

100
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.655
where the back side,

101
00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:03.505
the outer surface of the singlet has been mirrored.

102
00:06:03.505 --> 00:06:05.910
I've shown that with a big mirror here but,

103
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.575
in reality, you just deposit some metal on the outside of the lens.

104
00:06:09.575 --> 00:06:12.925
It turns out that this is a convenient real optic,

105
00:06:12.925 --> 00:06:18.505
it's put into telescopes and it cancels a particular aberration colts or collaboration.

106
00:06:18.505 --> 00:06:20.480
We'll learn about that later.

107
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.805
So let's just work through figuring out what the paraxial power of this system is.

108
00:06:26.805 --> 00:06:28.110
Now we could unfold this,

109
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.300
remember that it's always a good place to start.

110
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:37.650
And if we did, we'd have three lenses or three optical elements in intimate contact.

111
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.615
We'd have the first meniscus,

112
00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:42.330
then a mirror that has power,

113
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.240
and then of course we go backwards as the ray chunk here,

114
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.450
through the same meniscus again.

115
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.310
But if there are intimate contact, that's easy.

116
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.845
That just means the power of this total element

117
00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:56.150
is the sum of the powers of the three elements.

118
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.310
We can drop in what those powers are,

119
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.220
here we have the curvature of that first surface,

120
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.075
times index minus one.

121
00:07:05.075 --> 00:07:07.890
Then we don't accept the glass right?

122
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.935
So we don't really even see the second radius of curvature from the mirror,

123
00:07:10.935 --> 00:07:13.150
because we stay inside the glass.

124
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.375
Then we hit the mirror.

125
00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:15.690
So there is it's power,

126
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.400
two C, if the index was one.

127
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.180
And then we come back and hit the first surface again.

128
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.115
So there's the second exit or exiting the surface.

129
00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:34.180
And work through this and make sure you understand all the sign conventions.

130
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.440
Of course the first and last term look a lot the same.

131
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.920
So what this appears to be is actually a surface here twice,

132
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.665
there's the two, plus the effect of the mirror.

133
00:07:47.665 --> 00:07:53.035
So this is an example of how you apply what we've just learned to

134
00:07:53.035 --> 00:07:59.920
construct the equivalent paraxial power of more complex elements.
